# Module 5 Challenge: Pymaceuticals, Inc., Drug Analysis using Matplotlib and Pandas

This assignment is about Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Challenge Details

* Prepare the data by merging the data sets provided "mouse_metadata" and "study_results".

* Generate summary statistics DataFrame. 

* Create bar charts and pie charts using Pandas DataFrame.plot() method and with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.

* Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

* Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

* Calculate correlation and regression.

* Submit your final analysis.
 
## Assumptions made while coding

  **1.** The data CSV files that are reviewed for this analysis are present under the data folder of the Pymaceuticals folder.

  **2.** The python kernel path matches to the path where the challenge files are located.

  ## How to execute code?

  **1.** From the jupyter notebook, go to the cell column on the task bar and click on Run All option.
  
  **2.** Results for all the cells will be displayed under them for review.
 

### Prerequisites  
 * Need to have python3 installed.
 
 * The path to run the file on terminal should align with the folder path where the csv file is saved on machine.

 * Need to run the code in sequential order to activate the results from previous cells.

### Steps to run

  * From the Pymaceuticals folder under data-visualization-challenge, open "pymaceuticals_challenge_analysis.ipynb" file in Jupyter notebook.

  * First cell is the analysis of the data, where a brief summary can be found of the calculations done on the sample school and student data. 

  * Start running each cell starting with first importing the pandas library and other libraries needed to execute the code without any errors or from the jupyter 
    notebook, go to the cell column on the task bar and click on Run All option.

  * On the last cell, you can find the conclusions and comparisons from the analysis.

## Results 
 * Results of each cell are displayed under them individually.

 * There are few cells on the jupyter notebook that just have some mathematical operations done. This is done to prepare the data to be used in the next upcoming cells.

 * The written report on the first cell presents a cohesive written analysis that: 

    - Summarizes the analysis done.

    - Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations.

  * The written report "Analysis and Conclusion.docx"is attached as a word document in the output_data folder under the Pymaceuticals folder.

  * The output_data folder also contains the screen shots of the various graphs drawn as part of the analysis.
